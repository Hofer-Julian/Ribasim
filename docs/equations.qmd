Bach currently simulates the following "natural" water balance terms:

1. Precipitation
2. Evaporation
3. Infiltration
4. Drainage
5. Urban runoff 
6. Upstream flow
7. Downstream flow

Additionally, Bach simulates the following "allocated" water balance terms:

1. General user
2. Level Control
3. Flushing

Depending on the type of boundary conditions, Bach requires relation between
storage volume and wetted area ($A$), and between the storage volume and the
water level ($h$). These are (currently) represented by piecewise linear
relationships.

# Natural water balance terms
## Precipitation

The precipitation term is given by:

$$
Q_P = P A(S) 
$$

Where $P$ is the precipitation rate and $A$ is the wetted area. $A$ is a
function of storage: as the volume of water changes, the area of the free water
surface may change as well, depending on the slopes of the surface waters. 

## Evaporation

The evaporation term is given by:

$$
Q_E = E_{pot} A(S) * (0.5 \tanh(S - 50.0) / 10.0) + 0.5
$$

Where $E_{pot}$ is the potential evaporation rate and $A$ is the wetted area.
The $(0.5 \tanh(S - 50.0) / 10.0) + 0.5$ term ensures no evaporation occurs
when $S <= 0$ and is a sigmoid function which provides a smooth gradient as $S
\rightarrow 0$.

A straightforward formulation $Q_E = \mathrm{max}(E_{pot} A(S),
0)$ is unsuitable, as $\frac{\mathrm{d}Q_E}{\mathrm{d}S}$ is $\infty$ at $S =
0$. A hyperbolic tangent is a commonly used activation function
[@enwiki:1106669904] to approximate on-off behavior while preserving a smooth
derivative.

A non-smooth derivative results in extremely small timesteps and long
computation time: ModelingToolkit identifies the singular behavior and adjusts
it timestepping. In a physical interpretation, evaporation is switched on or
off per individual droplet of water. In general, the effect of the sigmoid term
is negligible, or not even necessary. As a surface water dries, its wetted area
decreases and so does the evaporative flux. However, for (simplified) cases with
constant wetted surface (a rectangular profile), evaporation only stops at $S =
0$.

## Infiltration and Drainage

Infiltration is provided as a lump sum for the basin. If Bach is coupled with
MODFLOW6, the infiltration is computed as the sum of all **positive** flows of the
MODFLOW6 boundary conditions in the basin:

$$
Q_{inf} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \max(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0)
$$

Where $i$ is the index of the boundary condition, $j$ the MODFLOW6 cell index,
$n$ the number of boundary conditions, and $m$ the number of MODFLOW6 cells in
the basin. $Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}$ is the flow computed by MODFLOW6 for cell $j$
for boundary condition $i$.

Drainage is a lump sump for the basin, and consists of the sum of the absolute
value of all **negative** flows of the MODFLOW6 boundary conditions in the
basin.

$$
Q_{drn} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left| \min(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0) \right|
$$

The interaction with MODFLOW6 boundary conditions is explained in greater
detail in the MODFLOW Coupling section of this documentation.

## Upstream and downstream flow

Bach's basins can be connected to each other, and each basin expects an
explicit connection. Two connections are currently available for inter-basin
flows:

1. ``OutflowTable``
2. ``LevelLink``

The flow direction of the basin is not pre-determined: flow directions may
freely reverse, provided the connection allows it. Currently, a ``LevelLink``
allows bidirectional flow, but the 

Additionally, two additional "connections" area available for the "outmost"
basins (external nodes) in a network.

1. ``NoFlowBoundary``
2. ``HeadBoundary``

### OutflowTable

The OutflowTable is a tabulation of a basin's discharge behavior. It describes
a piecewise linear relationship between the basin's storage volume and its
discharge. It can be understood as an emprical description of a basin's
properties. This can include a weir, but also the lumped hydraulic behavior of the
upstream channels.

The OutflowTable should indicate at which volume no discharge occurs (the dead
storage volume). 

:::{.callout-note}
Currently, the discharge relies only on the basin's volume; it could also use
the volume of both connected basins to simulate backwater effects, submersion
of weirs, or even reversal of flows for high precipitation events.

### LevelLink

A ``LevelLink`` connects two basins together. The flow between the two basins
is determined by a linear relationship:

$$
Q = C (h_a - h_b)
$$

Where $h_a$ is the water level in the first basin, $h_b$ is the water level in
the second basin, and $C$ is the conductance of the link. A ``LevelLink`` makes
no assumptions about the direction of the flow: water flows from high to low.

### NoFlowBoundary

This sets the exchange flow to 0.

### HeadBoundary

This sets the water level in the basin to a fixed level; lower or higher level
result in instantaneous corrective fluxes.

# Allocated water balance terms

Bach has been designed with the functionality to allocate water to different
users within each basin. The volume allocated is determined by the user demand,
the available water, and the priority of each user with respect to other users
within the same basin. The water demands for a given basin can be summarized into
three user categories. The handling of the allocation of water for different
user categories varies, as explained in more detail below.

 \def\qavail{{Q_\mathit{avail\:vol}}}
 \def\demwm{{D_{\mathit{wm}}}}
 \def\demuser{{D_{\mathit{user}}}}
$$

## General User

The General User category include the users Agriculture, Industry and Public
Water supply. These users extract water from the basin and the demand
($\demuser$) is determined externally.  The source of water allocated to the
General User is dependent on if the basin is a free-flowing type basin or a
level-controlled basin.

If the basin is free-flowing, the water source will be the available water within
the basin. If the basin is level-controlled additional water can be sourced from
the regional network, should the water available from the basin be insufficient
to satisfy $\demuser$.

The availability of water ($\qavail$) internally in a basin in a given timestep
is calculated by @eq-q-avail. This volume is available to be extracted by the
General Users. In the Bach prototype, additional water from the regional
network is currently modelled as an unlimited supply.

$$
\qavail = \frac{(P - E_{pot}) \cdot \mathit{area}}{\mathrm{Î”}t} - \min(0, Q_{infil} - Q_{drain} - Q_{runoff})
$$ {#eq-q-avail}

The $\qavail$ can be assigned to multiple users in the same basin. Allocation is
based upon user priority. For a given user, in the case where $\qavail >
\demuser$, the user demand is satisfied and the remaining $\qavail$ becomes
available for the user of next highest priority. For a given user, in the case
where $\demuser > \qavail$ then all of the available water is assigned to the
user. This results in an allocation shortage and no remaining local water for
any users of lower priority.

However, as discussed, if the basin is a level-controlled basin, additional water
can then be sourced from the regional network and is allocated to satisfy the
allocation shortage of the General User.

The allocation of water is decided intermittently by a separate process. This
separate process is not all-knowing and it may overextract. Like other water
balance sinks, negative storage is avoided and smooth numerical behavior is
ensured via an activation function:

$$
Q_{user} = Q_{alloc} * (0.5 \tanh(S - 50.0) / 10.0) + 0.5
$$

## Level Control

A level-controlled basin (`local_surface_water_type = "P"`) has a user demand
referred to as water management ($\demwm$). The purpose of this demand is to
maintain the water levels for each basin at a target level. This target levels is
determined externally. The $\demwm$ is negative if additional water is required
to increase the water level in the basin, or positive if there is surplus water
which must be removed to lower the level in the basin. When $\demwm$ is positive
and there is surplus water, Bach is designed to make any surplus water
available to General Users within the basin for abstraction. This is modelled by
adding the $\demwm$ to the $\qavail$ in calculated in @eq-wm.

$$
\qavail = \demwm
$$ {#eq-wm}

When the $\demwm$ is negative, the $\demwm$ is allocated first from the basin
$\qavail$, and then secondly with water from the national network, should the
local basin water not be sufficient to satisfy $\demwm$. This demand is therefore
handled similar to that of a General User. In the case that a General User is
allocated water as a higher priority than the Level Control such that the water
level of the basin decreases, the $\demwm$ will increase accordingly. However, in
most cases the demand for Level Control is higher than that of the General
Users so this does not occur.

## Flushing

The flushing requirement for the basin is a special case of user. Flushing is
required to maintain water quality in the basin. This is determined externally.
Water from the national network flows into the basin, and the same volume gets
removed from the basin back to the national network. This water cannot be
allocated to other users and there is no net change to the water level in the
basin or the $\qavail$, see @eq-flushing.

$$
\mathit{Q_{in}} = -\mathit{Q_{out}}
$$ {#eq-flushing}
