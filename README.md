# Bach

**Documentation: https://deltares.github.io/bach/**

Bach is a water resources model, designed to be the replacement of the regional
surface water module Mozart in the Netherlands Hydrological Instrument (NHI).
Bach is still a work in progress, it is a prototype that demonstrates all
essential functionalities. Further development of the prototype in a software
release is planned in 2022 and 2023.

Bach is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries, notably [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/).
